# csci_1300_project

This game was developed as a final project for the CSCI 1300 course I took in Fall 2018. It aims to replicate the experience of the 1971 text-based strategy video game "The Oregon Trail," originally developed by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann and Paul Dillenberger. My rendition follows the general layout of "The Oregon Trail," while also building new mechanics on top of the original designers' vision.
